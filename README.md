## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Description

The purpose of this project was to refactor code (improving it without changing what it does) and to make the website more accessible. Accessibility helps websites rank higher as well as avoid litigation.
I learned how to increase efficiency of CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties and organizing them so that they followed semantic HTML structure and elements.
